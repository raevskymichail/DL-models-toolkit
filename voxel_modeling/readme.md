# Implementation of 3D generative models

## 3D convolutional variational autoencoder (3dVAE)

Features:
- 4 convolution and 4 transposed convolutions
- customizable latent dimention (latent_dim=200 as default)
- batch normalization
    
Usage: See the notebook: 3D-Conv-VAE implementation (ModelNet Chair example)
