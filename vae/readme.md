# Variational Autoencoder

This is a generic VAE implementation with fully-connected encoders and decoders. The number layers and hidden nodes can be specified through the arguments to the VAE constructor. You can parse through "VAE example on MNIST.ipynb" to understand the usage. You can look at "Variational autoencoder implementation.ipynb" for how it is implemented.
